# VAE_generator

VAE, or Variational Autoencoder, is a type of generative model used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a neural network that learns to compress data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space, known as the latent space, and then learns to reconstruct the data from this latent space back into the original high-dimensional space. This allows VAE to generate new data that is similar to the original data, which can be useful for tasks such as image generation or data compression.

Here is an example of a simple VAE (Variational Autoencoder) implemented in C++ for generating AI art
