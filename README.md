# VAE_eigen

VAE, or Variational Autoencoder, is a type of generative model used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a neural network that learns to compress data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space, known as the latent space, and then learns to reconstruct the data from this latent space back into the original high-dimensional space. This allows VAE to generate new data that is similar to the original data, which can be useful for tasks such as image generation or data compression.
